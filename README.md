# StickerSnap: A simple Web app for sticker making

StickerSnap is a simple web SPA to create the best stickers out of your pictures using a computer vision model. It calls a remote service that simply has to conform to a very simple API: receive an image file through POST and return the sticker in the response!

Although this interface can easily work with about anything, it is particularly meant to work with [photo-stickers](https://github.com/nur-systems/photo-stickers). Open to contributions!
